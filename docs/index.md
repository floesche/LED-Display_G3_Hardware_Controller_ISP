# ISP Breakout

This is an additional PCB for the Controller which adds an ISP interface to the [Controller]({{site.baseurl}}/Generation%203/Controller/docs/g3_controller.html) as well as the possibility to directly interact with a [panel]({{site.baseurl}}/Generation%203/Hardware/docs/panel.html). For technical details have a look at the preview of the [schematics](assets/panels_isp_breakout.pdf).
